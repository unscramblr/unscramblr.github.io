The commercialization of this research also gave me the opportunity to work with some of the leading clients across the world and be engaged as part of the sales/pre-sales process.\n\nI helped architect and lead the development of a real-time business intelligence and fraud management solution at one of the largest telcos in the world. In 2010, we implemented a highly scalable system that was processing 9B xDRs in real-time. The solution was expanded and implemented at multiple other telcos. I also helped architect a real-time, personalized next-best-offer solution at one of the largest telcos in North America. I played a key role in helping IBM close this multi-million dollar software and services sale.\n\nI also played a key role in establishing a partnership between IBM, Excel-Medical and Emory Healthcare for real-time patient monitoring - specifically early detection of sepsis. I worked with MDs and leading researchers and deployed a prototype that paved the way for expanded work in this area.",

I also proposed the use of CDF to make probabilistic predictions about available bandwidth and won the best paper award at IEEE High Performance Distributed Computing Symposium 2006.\n\nIn and around 2006, with machine learning starting to take hold in systems research, I designed a novel state-space based approach for managing large enterprise-scale systems. I used clustering methods to detect homogeneous sub-spaces in a system's high-dimensional operational state-space and made use of Bayesian networks to model the sub-spaces and avoid SLA violations. I received the Best Paper Award for this work at the IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium 2008.",
