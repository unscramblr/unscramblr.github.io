In an era of data-driven decision-making, businesses often struggle to make sense of vast data stores quickly and effectively. That’s where Unscrambl Qbo steps in, an AI-powered "data analyst" designed to simplify data access, insights, and decision-making directly within collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams.

## Meet Qbo: Your AI Data Analyst on Demand

Imagine being able to ask complex business questions in natural language and receiving meaningful, actionable insights in seconds. Qbo enables users to simply type questions like:

- “Why is the spend in restaurants down this month?”
- “What is the predicted spending for the next 4 months in Texas for males aged 21-30?”
- “Show me the growth in spending for Nebraska in summer 2021, broken down weekly.”
- “Also show the count of transactions.”
- “Top 5 products in California in the first 3 months of 2021.”

Qbo's seamless integration within Teams allows business users to interact with data conversationally, obtaining answers and visualizations directly within their daily workflow. This AI "analyst" responds to questions, analyzes patterns, and even suggests insights, making data exploration intuitive and collaborative.

## Smart Notifications and Adaptive Learning

Qbo doesn’t just wait for users to ask questions; it proactively monitors Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and notifies users about significant changes. For instance, if overall spending declines but food delivery trends upward in a specific location, Qbo delivers a nudge: "While the overall spending declined last month, spending for food delivery saw an uptick in San Ramon ..."—complete with charts for deeper insights. Users can then continue exploring with follow-up questions, maintaining a natural, conversational flow with Qbo.

The AI’s adaptive learning also personalizes notifications over time, becoming more attuned to individual users’ interests and delivering insights most relevant to them.

## Data Stories: Giving Data a Voice
One of Qbo’s standout features is Data Stories. In today’s world, storytelling is key to effective communication, especially when it comes to complex data. Qbo allows users to transform their insights into impactful narratives through automated, editable data stories. These stories can be rendered as short videos, PowerPoint presentations, or PDF documents, making it easier than ever to share findings across teams and stakeholders.

## A Proven Solution for Leading Industries

Qbo has already been adopted by industry leaders:

Telecommunications: Qbo is used by one of the largest telcos in Indonesia to break down data silos and bring insights directly to operational teams.
Banking: Southeast Asia’s largest bank uses Qbo to streamline access to financial insights, facilitating faster, data-driven decisions across departments.
Insurance: In the Philippines, the leading life insurer relies on Qbo to make sense of customer data and develop personalized engagement strategies.

By enabling conversational AI-driven analytics, Qbo has reshaped how businesses interact with data, bridging the gap between complex data sources and everyday business users.
