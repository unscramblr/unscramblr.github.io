Ensuring compatibility, migrating large amounts of data, and maintaining system reliability are all substantial challenges. To streamline this transition, we’ve introduced a team of Generative AI-powered agents called the ETL Crew—a smart, autonomous team comprised of three specialized AI agents: Owl Lead (tech lead), Owl Dev (developer), and Owl QA (quality assurance engineer). Built on the CrewAI framework, the ETL Crew offers an efficient, automated ETL migration solution that incorporates human oversight at key stages, blending the benefits of automation with the assurance of human validation.</p> <p>This AI-driven solution integrates with Jira for task management, GitHub for version control, Microsoft Teams for communication, and Langfuse for prompt management, debugging, and cost tracking. At the core of this solution is the end-to-end (E2E) testing phase, which validates the success of each migration, ensuring the migrated code performs as expected and identifying any issues before final deployment.</p> <h2 id="the-etl-crew-key-components-and-workflow">The ETL Crew: Key Components and Workflow</h2> <h3 id="step-1-task-creation-and-assignment">Step 1: Task Creation and Assignment</h3> <p>The migration process begins with a human setting up a Jira task that includes all the necessary details, such as pointers to the legacy code in GitHub and validation datasets. Once assigned to the Owl Lead in Jira, the ETL Crew’s workflow kicks off, streamlining the migration process.</p> <h3 id="step-2-owl-lead-takes-charge">Step 2: Owl Lead Takes Charge</h3> <p>The Owl Lead operates as a tech lead, empowered by CrewAI’s prompt management capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Task Initialization and Analysis: Owl Lead moves the task to “In Progress” in Jira, acknowledges it in Microsoft Teams, and begins analyzing the task requirements using CrewAI’s natural language capabilities.</li> <li>Clarification Requests: If the task needs further details, Owl Lead communicates directly with the human task creator via Microsoft Teams or Jira comments to ensure clarity.</li> <li>Subtask Creation and Assignment: Once the task is clear, Owl Lead generates subtasks for Owl Dev and Owl QA in Jira and assigns specific responsibilities.</li> <li>Human-in-the-Loop Option 1: Before Owl Dev and Owl QA begin their tasks, a human can review and validate the subtasks created by Owl Lead, ensuring all instructions are clear and accurate for the AI agents.</li> </ul> <h3 id="step-3-owl-dev-in-action">Step 3: Owl Dev in Action</h3> <p>Owl Dev takes on the role of developer, translating and adapting the legacy code with CrewAI’s help:</p> <ul> <li>Code Analysis and Translation: Owl Dev retrieves the legacy ETL code from GitHub and uses CrewAI’s transformer-based models to adapt it to the target framework (e.g., Spark, AWS Glue).</li> <li>Automated Code Generation and Unit Testing: CrewAI enables Owl Dev to generate equivalent code for the target environment, along with unit tests to validate functionality.</li> <li>Commit and Pull Request: After generating the code, Owl Dev commits it to GitHub and raises a pull request, completing its part in the development process.</li> </ul> <h3 id="step-4-owl-qa-ensures-quality-with-critical-e2e-testing">Step 4: Owl QA Ensures Quality with Critical E2E Testing</h3> <p>Owl QA, the quality assurance agent, ensures the migration’s success through rigorous end-to-end (E2E) testing using the provided validation datasets—a critical step in the entire process:</p> <ul> <li>E2E Testing with Validation Datasets: Owl QA uses the validation datasets to run end-to-end tests on the migrated pipeline, ensuring it performs identically to the legacy system. This testing phase is essential as it verifies that the code has been correctly migrated, confirming accuracy and functionality.</li> <li>Error Detection and Notification: If errors are detected during E2E testing, Owl QA notifies Owl Dev, who then investigates and corrects the issues, committing changes as needed. This iterative feedback loop between Owl QA and Owl Dev guarantees that the final migration meets quality standards before progressing.</li> <li>Build and Test Execution: Using GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools, CrewAI triggers a build, runs unit and E2E tests, and logs results. Owl QA also provides progress updates via Microsoft Teams, ensuring all stakeholders are informed.</li> </ul> <p>Importance of E2E Testing: The E2E testing step is crucial as it verifies that the migrated code performs as expected, preventing issues from reaching production. Through validation testing, any inconsistencies are identified early, minimizing risk and reinforcing confidence in the migration’s success.</p> <h3 id="step-5-final-review-and-task-completion">Step 5: Final Review and Task Completion</h3> <p>With successful E2E testing, the Owl Lead returns to review and complete the migration:</p> <ul> <li>Code Review: Owl Lead conducts a thorough code review, checking for compliance with coding standards and CrewAI’s best practices.</li> <li>Approval and Merge: Upon final approval, Owl Lead merges the pull request in GitHub and updates the Jira task status to “Done”. <ul> <li>Human-in-the-Loop Option 2: A human reviewer may be introduced here to review the pull request before final merge, providing additional assurance that the code meets all migration criteria and quality standards.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Task Closure: After the PR merge, CrewAI sends a final update in Microsoft Teams, providing stakeholders with a summary of the completed migration.</li> </ul> <h2 id="video-demo-see-the-etl-crew-in-action">Video Demo: See the ETL Crew in Action</h2> <p>The accompanying video demonstrates the ETL Crew handling a complete migration, from task setup through E2E testing and final code merge. You’ll see each agent in action, along with the critical role of human validation at specific points in the workflow.</p> <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin: 1em 0;"> <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left:0; width: 100%; height: 100%" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Vb4oDTf8Gg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <h2 id="benefits-of-the-crewai-powered-etl-crew">Benefits of the CrewAI-Powered ETL Crew</h2> <p>The CrewAI-powered ETL Crew offers transformative benefits, significantly enhancing the speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability of ETL migrations:</p> <ol> <li>Reduces Migration Time by up to 40%: The ETL Crew automates repetitive and time-consuming tasks, enabling swift transitions between development, testing, and review stages.
